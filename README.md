## Only "Anything" and "Vegan" meal types are implemented.

## Meal plan algorithm:
Meal types(breakfast, dinner etc.) are rendered by user's input of how many meals they want to eat.
Each meal is rendered by the amount of calories. If a user enters a lot of calories meal quantity is increased.
A meal item can have max two servings as it is unhealty to have more at one meal time.
<br>
6 meal items were chosen in total for each meal type.
<br>
Average calorie intake for a user is assumed to be on average 1600-2000 calories. So meals were chosen appropriately.
<br>
An acceptable range of 45 was chosen based on the example i.e., if a user still has some calories left and is short by 45 that meal will be shown to him.
